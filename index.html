    <h1>Pollution</h1>
    <p>Pollution is the introduction of contaminants into the natural environment that cause adverse change.
   Pollution can take the form of chemical substances or energy, such as noise, heat or light. Pollutants, the components of pollution, can be either foreign substances energies or naturally occurring contaminants.  In 2015, pollution killed 9 million people in the world.</p>

<h2>Urban Pollution</h2>
<p>The burning of coal and wood, and the presence of many horses in concentrated areas made the cities the primary sources of pollution. The Industrial Revolution brought an infusion of untreated chemicals and wastes into local streams that served as the water supply. King Edward I of England banned the burning of sea-coal by proclamation in London in 1272, after its smoke became a problem,the fuel was so common in England that this earliest of names for it was acquired because it could be carted away from some shores by the wheelbarrow.</p>

<h6>Water Pollution</h6>
<p>Water pollution, by the discharge of wastewater from commercial and industrial waste (intentionally or through spills) into surface waters; discharges of untreated domestic sewage, and chemical contaminants, such as chlorine, from treated sewage; release of waste and contaminants into surface runoff flowing to surface waters (including urban runoff and agricultural runoff, which may contain chemical fertilizers and pesticides; also including human feces from open defecation â€“ still a major problem in many developing countries); groundwater pollution from waste disposal and leaching into the ground, including from pit latrines and septic tanks; eutrophication and littering.
